// Iterables--> on which we can use "for of" loop, as strings, arrays etc. or those from which we can extract values per index

// Objects are not Iterable, We can access this by index but not with values
// We can use "for in loop" on objects not "for of loop" 

// Array like iterables: if we can access them with index
